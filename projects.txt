Part 4:  FINAL SUBMISSION
Due:     June 6 (first day of finals)
File(s): finaltester.py final.pdf mytester.py
Points:  45

The tester submission is the same as last time.  However, this time
you may also submit a more-flexible verison of your algorithm as
mytester.py, which takes more parameters, or has a nicer configuration
interface, like the TSTL randomtester and other generators.  final.pdf
should, in at least 1,000 words, document (include graphs) some effort
to evaluate your algorithm, describe related work, etc.  Basically
final.pdf should be the core of a potential research paper submission
on your novel algorithm.  Of course, your method may be ineffective,
or too small a delta over an existing method to publish, but your aim
is to get as close to publishable results as possible!  If your method
did not fare well (results from the competitive bakeoffs will be
available), explain why.
